# Projects 
Here is a list of some of the main research projects I was involved in the last few years. Most of the projects have received funding either from the EU or from industry.

## [<u>“DynamoKG” Exploring dynamic and uncertain facts in knowledge graphs</u>](https://edge-research.eu/fellows/fabrizio-orlandi/)
#### Marie Skłodowska-Curie personal research fellowship (Sep 2019 - Sep 2021).
<br/>
*Role: P.I.*
<br/>
*Abstract:*

KGs are knowledge-bases of facts about entities and concepts (e.g., places, persons, artifacts) which are represented using the flexible structure of a graph. Facts are often extracted from encyclopedic knowledge, such as Wikipedia, or existing structured repositories (e.g. Wikidata), or even from unstructured sources such as social media posts (e.g. Facebook Graph). For example, a KG containing information about organisations is likely to include facts about companies, their founders, key persons, headquarters’ locations, number of employees, etc. However, facts related to entities or concepts that are dynamically changing over time are usually missing or outdated. The evolving dynamics of real world events are usually not reflected into knowledge bases. Hence, current repositories tend to represent only static snapshots of real world entities, ignoring their changes over time.
This project aims at exploring solutions for managing temporal and evolving aspects of KGs and leveraging such features for deeper data analysis.

## [<u>Knowledge Graph-based Legal Search over Court Cases</u>](http://fabriziorlandi.net/pdf/2020/ESWC2020_Industry_WKDLegal.pdf)
####Industry project, in collaboration with [Wolters Kluwer](https://wolterskluwer.com/), Germany (2018-2019).
<br/>
*Role: Scientific Lead and Scrum Master*
<br/>
*Abstract:*

The information contained in legal information systems is
often accessed through simple keyword-based search interfaces and presented as a
simple list of hits. In order to improve search accuracy one may avail
of knowledge graphs (KGs), where the semantics of the data can be made explicit. During this project we developed a KG-based search engine
designed for the entire corpus of German court cases mantained by Wolters Kluwer, Germany.

## [<u>KG-powered Video Summarization</u>](https://doi.org/10.1109/SITIS.2018.00098)
####Industry project, in collaboration with [Huawei Ireland](https://www.adaptcentre.ie/news/huawei-and-adapt-centre-launch-research-and-development-collaboration-to-tr) (2018)
<br/>
*Role: Lead Research Scientist*
<br/>
*Abstract:*

The amount of video content available on the Web is constantly growing. This has made it harder for viewers to discover the right visual content for them. Recommender systems are being offered by VoD services in order to automatically suggest potentially interesting videos to users. However, recommendations are typically based on: (i) limited video metadata fields, such as genre, title and actors; (ii) the content that other users liked; (iii) private or isolated data repositories. Our proposed approach leverages the richness of semantic technologies to enrich movie metadata, and create meaningful descriptions of movie scenes using video and audio processing techniques. This approach allows for the creation of a structured and interoperable Knowledge Graph (KG) describing movies and their content. This enables deeper data analysis of movie content at Web scale including, for example, algorithms for automatic video summarisation.
