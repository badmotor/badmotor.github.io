# Projects 
Here is a list of some of the main research projects I was involved in the last few years. Most of the projects have received funding either from the EU or from industry.

## [<u>“DynamoKG” Exploring dynamic and uncertain facts in knowledge graphs</u>](https://edge-research.eu/fellows/fabrizio-orlandi/)
Marie Skłodowska-Curie personal research fellowship (Sep 2019 - Sep 2021).

KGs are knowledge-bases of facts about entities and concepts (e.g., places, persons, artifacts) which are represented using the flexible structure of a graph. Facts are often extracted from encyclopedic knowledge, such as Wikipedia, or existing structured repositories (e.g. Wikidata), or even from unstructured sources such as social media posts (e.g. Facebook Graph). For example, a KG containing information about organisations is likely to include facts about companies, their founders, key persons, headquarters’ locations, number of employees, etc. However, facts related to entities or concepts that are dynamically changing over time are usually missing or outdated. The evolving dynamics of real world events are usually not reflected into knowledge bases. Hence, current repositories tend to represent only static snapshots of real world entities, ignoring their changes over time.
This project aims at exploring solutions for managing temporal and evolving aspects of KGs and leveraging such features for deeper data analysis.

## [<u>Knowledge Graph-based Legal Search over Court Cases</u>](http://fabriziorlandi.net/pdf/2020/ESWC2020_Industry_WKDLegal.pdf)
Industry project, in collaboration with [Wolters Kluwer](https://wolterskluwer.com/), Germany (2018-2019).

## [<u>KG-powered Video Summarization</u>](https://doi.org/10.1109/SITIS.2018.00098)
Industry project, in collaboration with [Huawei Ireland](https://www.adaptcentre.ie/news/huawei-and-adapt-centre-launch-research-and-development-collaboration-to-tr) (2018)
