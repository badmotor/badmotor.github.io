I'm a Research Scientist (<a href="https://edge-research.eu/fellows/fabrizio-orlandi/">Marie Skłodowska-Curie EDGE fellow</a>) at <a href="https://www.adaptcentre.ie/team-members/person-detail/fabrizio-orlandi">ADAPT Centre</a> based at <a href="https://www.tcd.ie">Trinity College Dublin</a>. Currently working with <a href="https://www.tcd.ie/research/profiles/?profile=osulldps">Prof. Declan O'Sullivan</a> and <a href="https://ie.linkedin.com/in/declanmckibben">Declan McKibben</a>, in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.adaptcentre.ie/industry/design-and-innovation-lab">Design & Innovation Lab (dLab)</a>, ADAPT Centre. 

<br />
My research interests are focused on Knowledge Graphs, Semantic Web, Web of Data, Knowledge Representation and the application of semantic technologies to different domains, such as Social Media, Personalisation and Open Data. In these areas, I have experience on foundational and applied research on both EU-funded and industry projects.

Prior joining ADAPT, I worked as postdoctoral researcher in the “Enterprise Information Systems” department at <a href="https://www.iais.fraunhofer.de/">Fraunhofer IAIS</a> and the <a href="http://sda.cs.uni-bonn.de/people/dr-fabrizio-orlandi/">“Smart Data Analytics”</a> group at the <a href="https://www.uni-bonn.de/">University of Bonn</a>. As senior researcher in the department, I had the role of coordinator (shared with <a href="https://tib.eu/auer">Prof. Auer</a>) in the EU H2020 <a href="http://openbudgets.eu/">OpenBudgets.eu</a> project, I supervised a group of nine people (both PhD students and software engineers) and contributed to European and industry research projects such as <a href="http://www.bigdataocean.eu/">BigDataOcean</a>, <a href="http://www.slipo.eu/">SLIPO.eu</a>, <a href="http://data.openbudgets.eu/page/dataset/budget-bonn-2019">Bonn-Budget</a>, <a href="https://opendataincubator.eu/">ODINE</a> and <a href="http://linda-project.eu/">LinDA</a>.

<br />
In 2014, I received my Ph.D. degree from the Faculty of Engineering at the <a href="http://www.nuigalway.ie/">National University of Ireland, Galway</a>. Prior to joining Fraunhofer, I contributed to research efforts (2010-2014) at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Enterprise_Research_Institute">Digital Enterprise Research Institute</a> (DERI), the largest Semantic Web research centre worldwide at the time. During <a href="https://aran.library.nuigalway.ie/handle/10379/4430">my PhD</a>, my primary research was on provenance for the Web of Data and user profiling across heterogeneous online communities. In 2014–2015, I was an <a href="https://fellowship.ercim.eu/">ERCIM</a> research fellow visiting <a href="https://www.iais.fraunhofer.de/">Fraunhofer IAIS</a> (Sankt Augustin) and the <a href="http://mayor2.dia.fi.upm.es/oeg-upm/index.php/en/index.html">Ontology Engineering Group (OEG)</a> at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM).
