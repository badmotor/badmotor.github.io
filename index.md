Prior joining ADAPT, I worked as postdoctoral researcher in the “Enterprise Information Systems” department at Fraunhofer
IAIS and the “Smart Data Analytics” group at the University of Bonn.  In 2014, I received my Ph.D. degree from the
Faculty of Engineering at the National University of Ireland, Galway. Prior to joining Fraunhofer, I contributed to research efforts (2010-2014) at the Digital Enterprise Research Institute (DERI), the largest Semantic Web research centre worldwide. During this time my research focused on provenance for the Web of Data and user profiling across heterogeneous online communities. In 2014–2015, I was an ERCIM research fellow visiting Fraunhofer IAIS. Currently, I have the role of
deputy coordinator in the H2020 OpenBudgets.eu project, I supervise a group of nine PhD students and software developers and contribute to EU H2020 projects such as BigDataOcean and SLIPO.eu.
